Read all docker compose, dockerfile and scripts and make sure you understand every single line, even if you know you will forget 1 or 2 commands in the future, keep the main idea at least

Local integration testing:manually make sure everything is working (endpoint by endpoint in backend), is an small app for now so unit testing is just for show

check the ui is properly using all endpoints

Kubernetes deployment: create manifests/helm, test in k8s (move this step earlier if you want to test k8s before deleting comments — see variant below).

README: update to reflect final deployment and operation details.
